  Local Eats

<p>Formerly Not UberEats<p>

This website was created to help showcase local restaurants in Toronto who offer their own delivery service.

By showcasing these restaurants I hope that we can help struggling businesses during this difficult time by putting more money in their pocket instead of third-party companies.

I built this site using Gatsby, using Contentful CMS and hosted on Netlify. For styling I'm using the React Bootstrap library.
